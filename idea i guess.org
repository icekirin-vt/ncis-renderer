* Idea:
Losing your place in the changing world
Finding peace in being a loner

fog\smog world? lots of heavy weather \ pollution?

re-listening old messages from people?

story-first game with intriguing characters, setting of mystery and good writing (i will try)
big on ambience and tactility of the world



physical movement is slow, hard to maneuver (weak body)
most of movement is done in digital






theme of losing connection

** Matching music:
Bones by Low Roar, Jofriour Akadottir


** Draft:
possbile protagonist name:

Cloud Corp?
